# Overview
Each folder contains scripts that are meant to quickly set up an OS the way I like it.

# Organization
> Scripts need to run in the same directory with user permissions

The scripts are numbered and named (ex. `3-swaywm.sh`) to represent when they were created and what their purpose is. After running `1-install.sh`, the rest of the scripts can be liberally chosen.

# Scripts Not Working?
