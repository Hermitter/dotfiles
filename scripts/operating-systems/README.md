# Overview
Each folder contains scripts that are meant to quickly set up a
Linux distribution the way I like it.

# Organization
The scripts are numbered and named (ex. `3-swaywm.sh`) to represent when they were created and what their purpose is. After running `1-install.sh`, the rest of the scripts can be liberally chosen.
