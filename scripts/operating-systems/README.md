# Overview
Each folder contains scripts that are meant to quickly set up an OS the way I like it.

# Organization
> Do not run scripts with sudo

The scripts are numbered and named to represent when they were created and what
their purpose is  (ex. `3-swaywm.sh`). After running `1-install.sh`, the rest of the scripts can be
liberally chosen.

# Scripts Not Working?
